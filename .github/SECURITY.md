# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously in the QKD Failure Detection System. The following versions are currently being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

This project deals with quantum cryptography and security-critical algorithms. Please be aware of the following:

### Cryptographic Security
- The QKD simulation implements theoretical protocols and should not be used for production cryptographic applications without proper security review
- Detection algorithms are designed for research and testing purposes
- Real-world deployment requires additional security hardening

### Data Sensitivity
- The system processes quantum key data and security metrics
- Ensure proper data handling in production environments
- Follow your organization's data protection policies

### Algorithm Validation
- Detection algorithms are validated against simulated attacks
- Real-world attack vectors may differ from simulation
- Regular security assessment is recommended

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps:

### 1. Initial Contact
- **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Send an email to: **security@qkd-project.example.com** (replace with actual email)
- Include "SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the subject line

### 2. Information to Include
Please provide the following information:
- **Vulnerability Type**: What type of security issue is it?
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected?
- **Attack Vector**: How can this vulnerability be exploited?
- **Impact Assessment**: What are the potential consequences?
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a minimal example (without causing harm)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 3. Response Timeline
We aim to respond to security reports within:
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **1 week**: Detailed analysis and response plan
- **2 weeks**: Fix development (for critical issues)
- **1 month**: Public disclosure (after fix is available)

### 4. Disclosure Process
1. **Private Discussion**: We'll work with you privately to understand and validate the issue
2. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you on timing for public disclosure
4. **Credit**: You'll be credited for the discovery (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use virtual environments for isolation
- Validate input data
- Monitor system logs
- Regular security assessments

### For Contributors
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use proper error handling
- Avoid hardcoded secrets
- Run security scans before submitting PRs

### For Researchers
- Use the system only for legitimate research
- Respect ethical guidelines
- Report findings responsibly
- Collaborate on security improvements

## Known Security Considerations

### Simulation Limitations
- The QKD simulator is for research purposes only
- Real quantum systems have additional security considerations
- Physical layer security is not fully modeled

### Attack Detection Limitations
- Detection algorithms are based on known attack patterns
- New attack vectors may not be detected
- False positives and negatives are possible

### Dependencies
- The project relies on third-party libraries
- Regular dependency updates are recommended
- Security scanning is performed automatically

## Security Tools and Scanning

This project uses automated security tools:
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Contact Information
